slim-redux-react
================

Official react bindings for [slim-redux](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux) which gives components access to the store through `subscriptions` and lets them modify the state through `change triggers`.

`slim-redux-react` uses [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) for implementing subscriptions efficiently and `slim-redux` [change triggers](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux#step-1-create-a-change-trigger) to make store changes a breeze.

## <a name="quick-start"></a>Quick Start  
To get started, have a look at the below code which is directly taken from the [counter example](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux-react/tree/master/examples/counter). It takes just two steps to get started with slim-redux-react:  

**Step #1: Call createSlimReduxStore(initialState, existingRootReducer, middleware)**  

```javascript
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import CounterContainer from './Counter';
import { createSlimReduxStore } from 'slim-redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

// Create the store, give it an initial state of 0 (and make redux store visible in redux-devtools browser extension)
const store = createSlimReduxStore(0, null, window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__());

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <CounterContainer/>
    </Provider>
  </div>  ,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Calling `createSlimReduxStore()` sets up a redux store with the slim-redux functionality injected (like its internal reducer function) but with all the functionality you know from redux.

Overall nothing fancy here, but notice that the second argument takes an existing rootReducer. slim-redux was specifically designed to be able to easily live alongside an existing redux setup. Time for...

**Step #2: Connect our react component to slim-redux**  
*(using `slimReduxReact()`)*
```javascript
// Counter.js
import React, { Component, PureComponent } from 'react';
import { slimReduxReact } from 'slim-redux-react';

// This could also be a regular or even a pure react component!
export const Counter = (props) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Current Counter: {props.counter}</h1>
    <button onClick={e => props.decreaseCounter()}>-</button>
    <button onClick={e => props.increaseCounter()}>+</button>
  </div>
)

export default slimReduxReact({
  component: Counter,

  // Subscriptions map parts of the state to props. The key of the object is the
  // propname, the value is the part of the state (separated by dots) that you
  // want to map to that prop. Here: Map state --> props.counter
  // Other Example: { completedTodos: 'state.todos.done'} etc.
  subscriptions: { counter: 'state'},

  // Change triggers are a slim-redux concept which combines defining actions and
  // reducers in one place. Notice how it's an object with definitions - normally
  // you would export these change trigger definitions from a separate file.
  changeTriggers: {
    increaseCounter: {
      actionType: 'INCREMENT',
      reducer: (state) => {
        return state + 1;
      }
    },
    decreaseCounter: {
      actionType: 'DECREMENT',
      reducer: (state) => {
        return state - 1;
      }
    }
  },
});
```

Subscriptions are probably self-explanatory but feel free to check out the [API reference](#api-reference) and [examples](#examples) to a few more examples on how subscriptions are used.  

Change triggers are a `slim-redux` concept which bundles action and reducer definitions in one place. You should be able to pick up everything you need to know about change triggers by [reading the intro in the slim-redux repo](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux#slim-redux).

**Quick reminder:** What you see above is the [counter example](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux-react/tree/master/examples/counter) which you can just `npm install` and then `npm start`. Might be quicker than setting it up yourself :)

## <a name="motivation"></a>Motivation  
While I love the general idea of redux in conjunction with react, I always struggled with the boilerplate overhead of react-redux quite a bit. I would even go as far as saying that redux setups pretty often were [incredibly confusing](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux#motivation) to me even though the [basic principles behind redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html) are incredibly simple.  

What made me especially mad is that more often than not the operations performed on the redux store were incredibly simple object modifications. Especially for small changes in the store the regular overhead in react-redux was really frustratring to me.  

When I read through the [core principles of redux]((http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html) I realized that the way that we work with redux & react-redux can be re-packaged to a much slimmer interface without going against the basic design principles behind redux.

Ultimately what motivated me to write [slim-redux](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux) & slim-redux-react is to hopefully allow teams to much more efficiently work with redux while not having to refactor their existing state management system which is often not an option.

## <a name="api-reference"></a>API Reference  
Since slim-redux-react builds on slim-redux, it might be worth checking out the [API reference for slim-redux](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux#api-reference) as well.

**Important:** In order for slim-redux-react to work, you need to wrap your application code in the `<Provider/>` component! [ðŸ¢‚ Example](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux-react/blob/master/examples/counter/src/index.js#L12)

### slimReduxReact(parameters)
Returns a react component that wraps the component in `parameters.component` and provides it with props that contain change triggers and subscriptions, according to `parameters.subscriptions` and `parameters.changeTriggers`.  

**Parameters:**
* *parameters.component*: The component to wrap
* *parameters.subscriptions*: Object in which the keys are the prop name to use when passing the subscribed to part of the state to the wrapped component. The value is a locator which determines which part of the store to subscribe to: "store.<property of store>.<sub property of store>...." (e.g. completedTodos: "store.todos.completed")
* *parameters.changeTriggers*: Object in which the keys are the prop name to use when passing the change trigger to the wrapped component. The value is a change trigger definition which is an object that follows the [slim-redux API for registering change triggers](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/slim-redux#storecreatechangetriggerparameters)

**Returns:** A wrapper component which provides the `parameters.component` component with subscription values and change triggers through props.  

**Example:**
```javascript
import React, { Component, PureComponent } from 'react';
import { slimReduxReact } from 'slim-redux-react';

export const Counter = (props) => (/* ... */)

export default slimReduxReact({
  component: Counter,
  subscriptions: { counter: 'state'},

  changeTriggers: {
    increaseCounter: {
      actionType: 'INCREMENT',
      reducer: (state) => {
        return state + 1;
      }
    },
    decreaseCounter: {
      actionType: 'DECREMENT',
      reducer: (state) => {
        return state - 1;
      }
    }
  },
});
```
