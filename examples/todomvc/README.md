# slim-redux-react TodoMVC Example
This classic TodoMVC example is actually an example of how you can refactor an existing react-redux application to use slim-redux-react.  
It's of course also an example of how you can build a TodoMVC with slim-redux-react, but if you take a look at the commit history for this example you can see how I refactored it from using react-redux.  

Install: `npm install`  
Run: `npm start`  

This copy'n'pasted from the react-redux repo (https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc) and was originally created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (which I can highly recommend!)
